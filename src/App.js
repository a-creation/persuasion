             <div id="howtoplay">About Persuasion</div>

                In a world of strong polarization, we often find ourselves in conversation with people with different beliefs and values. These conversations might feel uncomfortable or unproductive if we aren't sure how to approach them.

                We've created Persuasion to help players discover and practice how they might approach more polarized conversations through a risk-free, playful game space. Through this game, we hope players will feel comfortable being silly and trying different conversation strategies--good or bad--that they might never otherwise use, and learn more about how different ways of framing views can affect others!

                Keep on reading to learn how to play!

                <div id="howtoplay">Players</div>
                This game may be played with any number of players. Players will be organized into different groups of 2-3 for each round. The more players the merrier!

                <div id="howtoplay">Setup</div>
                <ol>
                <li>Print out the Persuasion card deck, and enough Score Sheets for each player.</li>
                
                <li>Shuffle the topic cards deck. Shuffle the role cards deck.</li>
                
                <li>Each player should take 1 Score Sheet and draw 1 card from the Role card deck. Players may look at the card they drew.</li>
                
                <li>Select a card from the Topic card deck, then take a quick survey of all players to check how many players believe each view related to the topic. If more than â…” of players hold the same view, discard the Topic card, select a new card, and repeat.</li> 
                
                <li>To begin a round, players will be given 1 minute to find and organize into groups of 2-3. Each group must include at least 1 player with an opposing view.</li>
                
                <li>At the end of each round, if players wish to play again, draw a new Topic card and Role card after shuffling both decks.</li>
                </ol>
                
                <div id="howtoplay">Gameplay</div>

                Groups will be given 5 minutes to discuss their views. Players must follow the instructions on their selected Role card throughout the discussion.
                At the end of the discussion, players will mark down how much the discussion changed their view for each opposing player, on a scale of 1-5.
                To play more rounds, players will discard their used Role card, then draw a new card. Repeat steps 1-4 with the same Topic card.
